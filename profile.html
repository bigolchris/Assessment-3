        <p>My current skills regarding Web Development are still very limited while I 
            feel a lot more confident than I did before starting this course there is still many things
            I have to learn. The learning process can be very daunting but its also exciting learning new things
            and knowing this is going to something that I can use for a career.
        </p>

        <p>Current Skills:</p>
        <li>Basic JavaScript knowledge</li>
        <li>Basic css</li>
        <li>Basic HTML</li>

        <p>My interest outside of programming and the course aren't too interesting, but I really
            enjoy skating even though I don't get to do it as often as I would like to anymore. Video games are
            a big part of my life and this is something that I see staying with me very late in life.
        </p>

        <p>My career goals after I complete the course is to get a job in the field I want. When I came into
            this course I really had it stuck in my mind that I would be doing front end web development
            but as we do more and more I am now leaning towards UX/UI design. This just seems to align more 
            with what I find fun and interesting.
